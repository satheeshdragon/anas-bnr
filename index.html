                  <span class="accred">What Is Accreditation</span><br><br>
                  Accreditation is an endorsement of a conformity assessment body's (CAB's) competence, credibility, independence and integrity in carrying out its conformity assessment activities.
              </div>
                <div id="run_text">
                  In everyday language the terms accreditation and certification are often used interchangeably. In the conformity assessment industry however, these terms have very different and specific meanings.
                </div>
                 <div id="run_text">
                  ISO's formal definition of accreditation is "third party attestation related to a conformity assessment body conveying formal demonstration of its competence to carry out specific conformity assessment tasks." (ISO/ IEC 17000:2004)

                 <div id="run_text">
                  Certification is "third party attestation related to products, processes, systems or persons." (ISO/ IEC 17000:2004)

                 <div id="run_text">
                  GAF-SAI only accredits organisations who provide certification and/ or inspection services. These organisations are known as Conformity Assessment Bodies (or CABs).

                  <div id="run_text">
                    In granting accreditation, GAF-SAI will specify the following details in the scope of accreditation:

                      Please complete the application form we provide when responding to your initial enquiry. The information requested is essential to us for selecting the appropriate technical expert(s) and to brief them prior to their visiting your organisation. Some of the important information we need in the questionnaire is:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Legal status of the organization</li>

                    <div class="f2">Authorised Representative</div>
                      A senior staff member of your organisation must be nominated to represent it in all<br><br>
            dealings with GAF-SAI. This person is the GAF-SAI point of contact with your organisation and is known as the Authorised Representative. All correspondence, invoices, etc which GAF-SAI sends to your organisation will be addressed to the Authorised Representative.<br><br>
            The Authorised Representative may be any senior staff member from either the technical or managerial staff. It is important that they are in a position of sufficient authority to ensure your organisation complies with the criteria for accreditation at all times.

    o A review of the Accreditation Questionnaire<br>
    o Resolution of any immediate queries that the assessors or staff may have.
                            </li>

                              The assessment ends with an closing meeting where representatives of your organisation are given the summary of findings, including details of any areas of non-compliance that have been found and guidance on correcting them.

                  Accreditation is fundamental to the proper operation of a transparent and quality driven conformity assessment market. It is a service offered to manufacturing and service industries, which supports their competitiveness. It is fundamental to the public authorities, in order to obtain the proper level of confidence in the reports and certificates issued anywhere in the world and thus to facilitate the free movement of products and services throughout the world. It is fundamental to the conformity assessment bodies themselves, whether operating in the regulated or in the non regulated fields of activity, in order to help them demonstrate independently their technical competence, impartiality and integrity and to ensure transparent and quality driven competition between themselves.

                  GAF-SAI aims at building and maintaining mutual confidence in the accreditation schemes operated by its members. It does so with the objective of ensuring that the certification and inspection services concerned meet the needs of industry and of the public authorities and of all other interested parties. In order for GAF-SAI to respond and be responsible to the needs of its stakeholders, and to ensure transparency in accreditation, a mechanism whereby GAF-SAI is answerable to and can receive input from its stakeholders is essential.
